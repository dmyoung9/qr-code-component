## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a simple exercise, but helped me figure out a few things. Namely, I was able to leverage the included style guide to get my variables figured out from the get-go. Also, I learned here how to use flexbox to position elements within the page.

### Continued development

My next challenge may be to learn about positioning multiple elements, especially relativie to one another.
